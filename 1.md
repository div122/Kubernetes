**What is Kubernetes?**

  Kubernetes is an open-source system that handles the work of scheduling containers onto a compute cluster and manages the workloads to ensure they run as the user intends.  it offers excellent community and works brilliantly with all the cloud providers to become a multi-container management solution. 

**Introduction:**

•	Kubernetes is a platform that eliminates the manual processes involved in deploying containerized applications.

•	Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

•	Kubernetes makes it easy to manage clusters with 1000's of containers running 1000's of micro services. 

•	We will be using containerizing (using Docker) and deploying a variety of projects to Kubernetes Clusters.

•	So, before containers came into existence, the developers and the testers always had a tiff between them. This usually, happened because what worked on the dev side, would not work on the testing side. Both of them existed in different environments. Now, to avoid such scenarios containers were introduced so that both the Developers and Testers were on the same page.

•	Handling a large number of containers all together was also a problem. Sometimes while running containers, on the product side, few issues were raised, which were not present at the development stage. This kind of scenarios introduced the Container Orchestration System

**Kubernetes Overview:**

 Challenges Without Container Orchestration :
 
 In the above diagram when multiple services run inside containers, you may want to scale these containers. In large scale industries, this is really tough to do.
 That’s because it would increase the cost to maintain services, and the complexity to run them side by side.Now, to avoid setting up services manually & overcome 
 the challenges, This is where Container Orchestration Engine comes into the picture.This engine, lets us organize multiple containers, in such a way that all the
 underlying machines are launched, containers are healthy and distributed in a clustered environment.
 In today’s world, there are mainly two such engines: Kubernetes & Docker Swarm.    

**Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm:**

•	Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are leading container orchestration tools in today’s market. So before using them in prod, you should know what exactly they are and how they work.

•	Kubernetes, when compared with Docker Swarm owns a great active community and empowers auto-scaling in many organizations. Similarly, Docker Swarm has an easy to start cluster when compared to Kubernetes, but it is limited to the Docker API’s capabilities.  
 
•	 If my pick between the two I will choose Kubernetes , since, containers need to be managed & connected to the outside world for tasks such as scheduling, load balancing& distribution.

•	Kubernetes being an undisputed leader in the market and also does run on top of Docker containers with better functionalities.

**Kubernetes Features:**
 
**Automated Scheduling:** Kubernetes provides advanced scheduler to launch container on cluster nodes based on their resource requirements and other constraints.

**Self Healing Capabilities:** K8 allows to replaces & reschedules containers when nodes die.  Those containers which are failed during the execution process, Kubernetes restarts them automatically. And, those containers which do not reply to the user-defined health check, it stops them from working automatically. It also kills containers that don’t respond to user-defined health check and doesn’t advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.

**Automated rollouts & rollback:** Using rollouts K8 distributes changes & updates to application or its configuration. If any problem occurs in the system, then this technique rollbacks those changes immediately. 

**Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing :**  This feature uses HorizontalPodAutoscalar to automatically increase or decrease the number of pods in a deployment, replication controller, replica set, or stateful set on the basis of observed CPU utilization. Automatic Bin Packing: Kubernetes helps the user to declare the maximum and minimum resources of computers for their containers.

**Service Discovery and load balancing:** Kubernetes assigns the IP addresses and a Name of DNS for a set of containers, and also balances the load across them.

**Persistent Storage:** Kubernetes provides 'persistent storage' for storing the data, which cannot be lost after the pod is killed or rescheduled. Kubernetes supports various storage systems for storing the data, such as Google Compute Engine's Persistent Disks (GCE PD) or Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS). It also provides the distributed file systems: NFS or GFS.

**Kubernetes Architecture:**
 
The architecture of Kubernetes follows the client-server architecture. It consists of the following two main components:

•	Master nodes (Control Plane)

•	Worker/Slave nodes

**Master Node:**

The master node is responsible for the management of Kubernetes cluster. It is mainly the entry point for all administrative tasks. There can be more than one master node in the cluster to check for fault tolerance. The master node has various components like API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler & ETCD.
 
**API Server:** The API server is the entry point for all the REST commands used to control the cluster. The Kubernetes API server receives the REST commands which are sent by the user. After receiving, it validates the REST requests, process, and then executes them. After the execution of REST commands, the resulting state of a cluster is saved in 'etcd' as a distributed key-value store.

**Controller Manager:** also known as a controller. Is a daemon that regulates the Kubernetes cluster, and executes different non-terminating control loops.  The controllers in a master node perform a task and manage the state of the cluster. In the Kubernetes, the controller manager executes the various types of controllers for handling the nodes, endpoints, etc.

**Scheduler:** The scheduler schedules the tasks to slave nodes. It stores the resource usage information for each slave node. In other words, it is a process that is responsible for assigning pods to the available worker nodes.

**ETCD:**  is a simple, distributed, consistent key-value store. It’s mainly used for shared configuration and service discovery. which is used to store the cluster data. 

**Worker/Slave node:**

The Worker node in a Kubernetes is also known as minions. A worker node is a physical machine that executes the applications using pods. It contains all the essential services which allow a user to assign the resources to the scheduled containers . The worker node has various components like Docker Container, Kubelet , Kube-proxy, and Pods.
 
**Docker Container:** Docker runs on each of the worker nodes, and runs the configured pods
**Kubelet:** Kubelet gets the configuration of a Pod from the API server and ensures that the described containers are up and running.
**Kube-proxy:** Kube-proxy acts as a network proxy and a load balancer for a service on a single worker node
**Pods:**  It is the smallest and simplest basic unit of the Kubernetes application. This object indicates the processes which are running in the cluster. A pod is one or more containers that logically run together on nodes.
